        <h1> The Mysteries of Dark Energy </h1>
        <h5> Dark energy is a mysterious and invisible form of energy that makes up roughly 68% to 70% of the universe. Even though scientists donâ€™t fully understand what it is, they know it must exist because of the way it affects the universe. Unlike regular matter or dark matter, dark energy has a repulsive effect, causing space to expand. It behaves like a negative pressure, pushing galaxies apart faster and faster. Whether dark energy is an actual force, a property of space, or a hint that our understanding of gravity is incomplete, remains one of the biggest unsolved questions in cosmology. </h5>
